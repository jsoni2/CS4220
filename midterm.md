Teams of (4-5) will create a presentation on a node module listed on npm - [https://www.npmjs.com]().

Each member of your team will present for **a maximum of 1 minute**. The team presentation should only be **4-5 minutes in total**

Your presentation will be graded based the following areas:

#####1 - Presentation time.
- Did you and your group members stay within the time limit?

#####2 - Explaination of node module.
- Did you clearly explain your node module?
- Did you discuss what problem(s) your module solves when using it inside a Node.js application?

#####3 - Comparison of your node module using code.
Research and find a node module (from npm) that does the same thing or something very similar to the one your team picked.

Give a code example of your module (5 - 10 lines) and of the competitor (5 - 10 lines). Walk through the code and explain the differences between your module and the one your are comparing.

- Did you explain the code written?
- Does the code explain the differences in the two node modules?
- Does the code execute?
- Was your explanation clear?
